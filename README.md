# Data-Science-Project-Prototypes
This repository serves as a catalog of robust, end-to-end data science project prototypes. It includes detailed examples covering data wrangling, feature engineering, model training (using frameworks like Scikit-learn and TensorFlow/PyTorch), and performance evaluation. Focus is placed on clean, production-ready code structure and reproducibility.
